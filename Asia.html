            <p>Asia is the largest continent by both size and population-a diverse, multicultural melting pot of some of the oldest civilizations on earth. There's so much to see and do in Asia, it's hard to narrow it down to a shortlist-it could take you months to truly explore just one country.</p>
            <ul>

                    <h2>Mount Fuji, Japan</h2>
                    <img src="images/fuji.jpg">
                    <p>Although Mount Fuji is an active stratovolcano, it hasn't erupted since 1708. The stunning snowcapped mountain is one of Japan's "Three Holy Mountains," which are traditionally considered to hold a particular power-Mount Fuji has volcanic power.</p>
                    <p>If this doesn't sound ominous enough, the base of the mountain is also home to Aokigahara. Also known as "The Suicide Forest," this dense forest growing on hardened lava is home to ice caves, a combination that absorbs sound and creates an eerie feeling of solitude.</p>
                    <p>While many visitors come here to just photograph this World Heritage List Cultural Site and well-known symbol of Japan, others arrive for the climbing opportunities. Until the late 19th century, women were not allowed to make their way to the summit (which is still considered a sacred site), so visitors of all ethnicities, genders, and ages now arrive to make up for lost time.</p>
                    <p>There are four possible routes to reach the top of the mountain, and all offer a number of stops along the way in the form of shrines, historical monuments, and even teahouses.</p>

                    <h2>Dead Sea, Israel</h2>
                    <img src="images/deadSea.jpg">
                    <p>The dark blue waters of the Dead Sea touch the borders of both Jordan and Israel. Actually a lake despite its name, the Dead Sea sits at the lowest land elevation on Earth-over 430 meters below sea level. With a salt concentration of around 31 percent-almost 10 times saltier than the ocean -the Dead Sea is so thick, nothing can sink into it, and everyone who walks into it will naturally float.</p>
                    <p>While the coastline around the lake has become a flourishing spa and resort destination, there is also a large influx of religious tourism in the area. Jericho, the city where Jesus is said to have healed blind beggars, is located just minutes northwest of the Dead Sea-and a number of other cities, including the legendary Sodom and Gomorra, as well as Zoar and Admah, are also located in this area. The area boasts some of the oldest inhabited cities in the world.</p>

                    <p>While the lake is too salty to support aquatic life, there are plenty of animals that call the surrounding desert home-and hikers will run into anything from hares to foxes and leopards when exploring the nature reserves around the Dead Sea</p>

                    <h2>Phuket, Thailand</h2>
                    <img src="images/phuket.jpg">
                    <p>Thailand's biggest island is also a magnet for visitors-and for good reason. Phuket boasts some of the best beaches in the country, with clean, soft, rolling sands and turquoise waters as far as the eye can see.</p>
                    <p>Kata, Hat Karon, and Kamala beaches see a lot of tourists during the high season (November to February) but remain sleepy little villages once the rains arrive. Beautiful coral reefs line up the coastline, offering amazing opportunities for snorkeling and diving but also sea kayaking and island hopping.</p>
                    <p>In between hours of lying under the sun, visitors can head to the white and gold Wat Chalong, the largest and most important Buddhist temple on the island, or climb up a hill to reach the Big Buddha-a 45-meter-tall statue covered with Burmese marble.</p>
                    <p>The island is also home to a number of unique festivals. The Ghost Festival during the 7th Chinese lunar month is dedicated to ancestor worship, and it entails releasing lanterns into the ocean to help guide lost souls-a sight to behold.</p>
                    <p>The Vegetarian Festival during the 9th Chinese lunar month is another stunning celebration, which, despite the name, is not so much about food but about purification and putting the body through extreme tests, such as fire walking and hanging from hooks.</p>

                    <h2>Beijing, China</h2>
                    <img src="images/beijing.jpg">
                    <p>One of the most populous cities in the world, Beijing is also one of the oldest. You can get a peek into that history by walking the hutongs of Beijing, the narrow alleyways lined up with traditional homes and courtyards.</p>
                    <p>China's capital is home to seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Imperial Summer Palace and its gardens, the oldest canal in the world, and the Forbidden City-a palace complex that served as the home of China's emperors for 500 years starting in the 1420s. The Forbidden City-made up of almost 1,000 different buildings-is one of Beijing's most impressive tourist attractions.</p>
                    <p>The city also offers visitors many unique-looking pagodas and temples, including the 12th-century, eight-sided Tianning Temple, as well as almost 150 museums and galleries.</p>
                    <p>The Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution and the National Art Museum of China have massive collections and are well worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Several sections of the Great Wall can also be found within Beijing, including the wall's most visited site, the 80-kilometer-long Badaling section.</p>

                    <h2>Hoi An, Vietnam</h2>
                    <img src="images/hoiAn.jpg">
                    <p>Most visitors arriving in Vietnam land in either Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, or head straight to Halong Bay and the beach-but Vietnam's best place to visit is actually a well-guarded secret.</p>
                    <p>The ancient city of Hoi An is home to one of Asia's oldest trading ports and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A major commercial stop for trading ships as far back as the 15th century, Hoi An still maintains much of its original architecture in the form of timber frame buildings, colorful French-colonial shutters, and Chinese tiled roofs. Religious buildings, courtyards, and shophouses sit side by side on narrow alleyways all across Ancient Town, Hoi An's historical center.</p>
                    <p>Every full moon cycle, Hoi An celebrates the Lantern Festival, which honors ancestors through light. On the night before the full moon, all the lights in the Ancient Town are turned off, and colorful lanterns and candles are placed on windows, inside houses, and on boats lazily floating down the river.</p>
                    <p>Visitors at other times of the month can walk Hoi An to discover the Museum of History and Culture (originally a pagoda dedicated to the Goddess of Compassion, Guan Yin); the 17th-century covered Japanese bridge; and the Old House of Tan Ky, a preserved 18th-century merchant's house.</p>
